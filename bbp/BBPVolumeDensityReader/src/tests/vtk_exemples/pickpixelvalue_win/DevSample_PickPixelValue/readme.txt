This application shows how to use a mouse move observer with a point picker
to get the scalar value of the pixel the mouse is over. The image is rendered
using vtkImageViewer2. Look at VtkObserverMouseMove.cpp for specifics of how
the picking is done.

Please post any comments or questions, thanks.
